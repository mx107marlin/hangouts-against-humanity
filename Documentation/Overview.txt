Hangouts Against Humanity - Project Overview

Hangouts Against Humanity is a Google App Engine-powered game for Google+
hangouts written in Javascript and licensed under the GPLv3 or any later version.
The main game logic which resembles Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples
is completely expandable by creating a CSV card database and selecting it before
the game begins. (The selection UI will not be completed until after the 
first 1.0 release).
