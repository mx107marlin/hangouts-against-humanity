Hangouts Against Humanity - Database Documentation

Hangous Against Humanity uses a CSV-based card database to store playing cards.
There are 4 main fields to a card database: ID, Color, Text, How many cards are picked?.

    ID - 512
        The ID field is a unique identifier for that particular card.
    Color - 1
        The Color field distinguishes the card on the table from the cards in player's hands.
    Text - Rumor has it that Vladimir Putin's favorite dish is _ stuffed with _.
        The Text field is the literal representation of the text written on the card.
    How many cards are picked? - 2
        The How many cards are picked? field tells how many cards should be played this turn.

Both cards on the table and cards in player's hands are stored in the same CSV database,
this allows for easy expansion packs to be created by users/modders. An entire 
mod can now be stored in a single file.
